# stata

This repository contains useful Stata codes. 

Some of the current folders house examples for each task that a researcher/research assistant may perform from producing tables or graphs to cleaning datasets. 

The folder `template_folder' is an example of folder that you can copy and paste at the beginning of any project. It is meant to reduce the initial costs of setting up a project. 

If you want to add more useful examples and codes, please respect the following:
- Use sysuse / easily accessible data so that anyone can run the snippets of code independently of each other.
- Indicate the Stata version that you are using for each, and specify any required user-maintained packages
- Add plenty of comments to clarify what the non-trivial commands do 
- Please credit appropriately!
